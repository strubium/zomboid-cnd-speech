-- Firstly, thank you for stopping in; I hope you enjoy your time here.

-- Steps:
---- 1. If there is not a directory for your language with in "/media/lua/client/shared/Translate/" then create one.
------ 1a. Copy over this file to "Translate/<LANGUAGE>" and rename it to "UI_<LANGUAGE>" (for example: UI_EN.txt)
---- 2. Under the instructions there is the 'header' for a list - make sure the name matches the text file's name.
------ For example: Both the text file and list should be UI_EN, UI_RU, UI_FR, etc.
---- 3. You're ready to translate! Only change things bellow

-- Phrases can be found in "/media/lua/client/shared/Translate/"
--- (the folder of your language, for example: EN, RU, FR, will include everything you need.)

-- You can add more phrases than what is available, just make sure the numbers at the end of the entry follows numerically.
--- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc)

-- When Writing New Phrases:
-- 1. Keep them short when you can.
-- 2. Don't capitalize anything other than 'I' or proper nouns.
-- 3. Punctuation is fine, but keep in mind all '.' can become '!' - so avoid things like U.S.A. or F.B.I. (USA and FBI are fine)
-- 4. Avoid swears (as there is dynamic swearing built-in), instead use <SWEAR>.
-- 5. For the moment any *emotive actions* have to be the entire phrase (which won't be filtered).

-- For more variety and to avoid bloat from repetitive phrases, phrases can be used as Keywords to replace parts of another phrase at random.
-- Format: "<WORD> in the phrase." Make sure there is a corresponding PhrasesWORD phrase-set.
-- When writing new Phrases to be used as keywords: Read through some lines with <WORD> to make sure it sounds correct before adding them in.
-- For example: Look at "UI_Phrases_FOOD" and <FOOD> below.

-- DO NOT TRANSLATE KEYWORDS LIKE <WORD> OR <SWEAR>.

-- NOTE: THE TABLE HEADER "UI_XX" MUST MATCH THE IN GAME LANGUAGE ABBREVIATION

-- These are for the config options - leave "\n" in for line break purposes.
